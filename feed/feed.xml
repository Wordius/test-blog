&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Apple’s Vision Pro&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having had &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordius.com/about/&quot;&gt;a stroke&lt;/a&gt; a couple of years ago, I won’t be trying out Apple’s Vision Pro. I’ll leave that to all the trailblazers with deep pockets. For more about medical conditions and the Apple Vision Pro, see this &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT213935&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had envisioned it as being a bit like in the movie &lt;em&gt;Minority Report&lt;/em&gt;, spatial computing rather than facial computing. But that appears to be far from the reality, as revealed in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/apple-vision-pro-headset-review/677347/&quot;&gt;The Apple Vision Pro is Spectacular and Sad&lt;/a&gt;, by Ian Bogost, writing for the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke, specifically, is not mentioned in Apple’s article. But from what I’ve read around the web, I don’t want to risk having that feeling again.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/iU5RO6wd-G-4032.avif 4032w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/iU5RO6wd-G-4032.webp 4032w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Macbook Air 2017&quot; caption=&quot;undefined&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/iU5RO6wd-G-4032.png&quot; width=&quot;4032&quot; height=&quot;3024&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Macbook Air 2017&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 30 years of Macs crammed into a few hundred words… Shouldn’t be too difficult, he says, as his 60th approaches at a rate of knots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of my earlier Macs weren’t bought for their specs, beyond the simple matter of storage space and RAM. To the best of my knowledge it went something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;macintosh-quadra-680&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Macintosh Quadra 680 &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 1994 I bought my first Mac because I needed something to use at home capable of running QuarkXpress, which I needed for my work. I paired it with an Apple monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mac-quadra-800-tower&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Mac Quadra 800 (tower) &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second was a big step up at the time. I needed the computer to handle Quark with ease, which it did. And PhotoShop, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;imac-21in&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;iMac 21in &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iMac was my first foray into unibodied Macs. It worked so well that I’ve finally returned to using an iMac, only this time the bigger model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;macbook-pro&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;MacBook Pro &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only Mac to fail on me, but that only happened after at least five years of ownership. Meantime, it travelled the world, whether I was roaming around the US or Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-mac-mini-with-27in-apple-vision-pro-monitor&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;A Mac Mini with 27in Apple Vision Pro monitor &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a step in the wrong direction. While the monitor was fine, the Mac Mini was a constant letdown. Slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;mac-mini&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Mac Mini &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second Mac Mini followed. It was my first venture into second-hand Macs. I bought the Mini from &lt;a href=&quot;https://backmarket.co.uk&quot;&gt;Backmarket&lt;/a&gt;, a company well versed in the used Apple tech sphere. It worked. Perfectly. And I sold it on when it had run its course. Which is more than I can say for the monitor, which had given up the ghost by then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;imac-27in-2017&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;iMac 27in, 2017 &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current workhorse, a 2017 iMac bought in 2023, also from Backmarket. It’s quick for my needs and up to the task of running all the Adobe apps I need for work, such as InDesign, PhotoShop and Illustrator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;macbook-air-13in-2017&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;MacBook Air 13in, 2017 &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My writing tool. It has everything installed on it apart from the Adobe products mentioned earlier. Among the software installed is Obsidian, my choice of note taking app, NetNewsWire (RSS reader), Omnivore (read later), and Alfred, with all of its workflows and snippets. Bought from Backmarket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;iphones&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;iPhones &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had no end of iPhones, but the last, the 5S, stuck around for longest. Its replacement is the similarly sized SE 2020 (Backmarket). I like my phones small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ipads&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;iPads &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2024-02-06-my-life-in-macs/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first iPad I owned was the 2nd generation model. That was eventually followed by 6th generation (Backmarket), which I still have. Over time I’ve tried to use it as my writing station, but that never lasted long. That’s why I bought the MacBook Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along the way I’ve experimented with a PC and a couple of Chromebooks, but neither stuck around for long.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Keep it simple when establishing an editorial workflow</title>
		<link href="http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/"/>
		<updated>2015-03-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Editorial workflows should be simple. Where a team is involved, the simpler the better. Any member of an editorial team should be able to step in and know where others have left off, avoiding delays when another team member is absent, however important that person is to the team. While my workflows do not usually involve others, they adhere to the same principle – simplicity is best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects are separated into two workflows according to type: books and everything else. All projects, regardless of type, are written or edited in a Markdown editor and saved in plain text format. Only if the demands of a particular client requires it is a piece of work output and delivered in an alternative format, such as rich text (.rtf).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-book-workflow&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The book workflow &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manuscripts for books always arrive as MS Word documents. I refuse to buy that unnecessarily sluggish and overweight application, preferring the fast, lightweight, distraction-free nature of a Markdown editor. Pages for Mac, therefore, becomes the middleman between books supplied as MS Word documents and my Markdown editor of choice, Ulysses for Mac (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses/id623795237?mt=12&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot; title=&quot;Ulysses for Mac&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, $40). When a book arrives for editing, I open the document in Pages for Mac, Select All (⌘-A), Copy (⌘-C), close the Pages document, open Ulysses for Mac, create a new ‘Group’ in the iCloud section of the sidebar, name it using the book’s title, add a new ‘sheet’ (⌘-N), and paste the entire book into that ‘sheet’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next step is to ‘split’ the book into its component parts, or chapters. Working my way through the manuscript in Ulysses, I place the cursor after the book title, the prelims, and individual chapters, and split (Edit &amp;gt; Split at selection) the document as I go. When I am finished each book part has its own sheet. Then I select all of the sheets and glue (⌘-J) them together. The action of ‘gluing’ comes in handy at the end of a project when I may want to output the book as a single file again, usually in .rtf format, for further processing, or typesetting. The entire process of setting up a book project like this in Ulysses generally takes less than 10 minutes. Editing it takes somewhat longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/-xbD9QsOjI-588.avif 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/-xbD9QsOjI-588.webp 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;An example book project in Ulysses&quot; caption=&quot;An example book project in Ulysses&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/-xbD9QsOjI-588.png&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; height=&quot;441&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;An example book project in Ulysses&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of Ulysses for iPad (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ulysses-for-ipad/id950335311?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, $19.99) last week means I can now work on book projects on my favourite writing and editing device, with everything synced via iCloud. Existing users of Ulysses for Mac will appreciate the iPad app’s similarity to the desktop version, which provides a near-seamless experience and transforms The Soulmen’s flagship software into a go-anywhere app. I will return to discussing Ulysses for iPad later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-everything-else-workflow&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The ‘everything else’ workflow &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say ‘everything else’, I mean absolutely everything – articles for print, whether I am writing them or merely editing them, blog posts, general notes, instructional notes, stylesheets, manuals and more. Every piece of writing, amounting to thousands of documents accumulated over the past few years, resides in a single folder. The location of that folder has changed a number of times over the years, but the documents inside it have all stayed together. Currently that ‘folder’ is the one for 1Writer (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/1writer-note-taking-writing/id680469088?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, $2.99) located in iCloud Drive on my Mac. All documents can be accessed using any text editor on my Mac, including Ulysses, where it can be added as an External Source. It is worth noting that when the 1Writer folder is added to Ulysses it returns an item called ‘Documents’, not ‘1Writer’. Don’t ask. Those same documents are then also available to me in 1Writer on my iPad and iPhone. I rarely use the latter, but it is important to have access to those notes wherever I am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single folder concept evolved from using Brett Terpstra’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/&quot; title=&quot;nvALT&quot;&gt;nvALT&lt;/a&gt; – all notes in plain text, all notes in a single folder, all notes accessible anywhere. nvALT serves as a repository on my Mac, reading all notes from the 1Writer folder mentioned above. The only reason it is not the app I use for writing and editing is its lack of syntax highlighting, which is present in most every other Markdown editor I could name, with the exception of &lt;a href=&quot;http://desk.pm&quot; title=&quot;Desk app&quot;&gt;Desk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desk-write-more/id915839505?mt=12&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot; title=&quot;Visit the App Store&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, £20.99), a relatively new addition to the Markdown editor fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secret to keeping all your notes organised in a single folder is a solid naming convention. In the past I wrote about Tyler Reinhard’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordius.com/semantic-notes/&quot; title=&quot;Semantic notes&quot;&gt;Semantic Notes’&lt;/a&gt; system, which I still use parts of today, but in the interim I have taken on a number of new projects that involve generating numerous additional documents every month. For example, I recently became the editor of a monthly newspaper, &lt;em&gt;Wrights Farming Register&lt;/em&gt;, wait for it, about farming machinery. As the sole member of the editorial staff, I generate around 80% of the content; the remainder comes from contributors. I process their copy from MS Word documents to my Markdown editor in the same way I do my own. Here is how those files are named:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;wfrx-201504-22-section-name.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part of the file name, &lt;code&gt;wfrx&lt;/code&gt;, singles out all documents relating to content for Wrights, the first string of numbers gives me the issue, the second string the page number, and lastly there’s the section name – news or plant and machinery, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I want to see only those documents relating to the current issue of Wrights, in this case the April issue, I target Ulysses for Mac’s sheet search field (⌘-⇧-F) and type &lt;code&gt;wfrx-201504&lt;/code&gt; (below – note that this document, unrelated to Wrights, also appears because the body contains that same string of letters and numbers). I can do the same in 1Writer on my iPad to filter out all documents other than those for the current issue of Wrights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/XSriQBgBg7-588.avif 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/XSriQBgBg7-588.webp 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Filtering files in Ulysses. Note the entry in the search field at the bottom of the screenshot&quot; caption=&quot;Filtering files in Ulysses. Note the entry in the search field at the bottom of the screenshot&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/XSriQBgBg7-588.png&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; height=&quot;397&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Filtering files in Ulysses. Note the entry in the search field at the bottom of the screenshot&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘x’ after ‘wfr’ denotes that a document is part of an issue’s content. If I want to filter to all content ever produced for Wrights, I can simply search for ‘wfrx’, thus avoiding administrative notes I have for that publication where the title is often abbreviated as ‘WFR’. Searching in many apps is full depth, which means it returns any document that contains your query, not only those that have it in their file name. Hope that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a similar manner, I prepend filenames for posts to this blog with ‘wdx’, e.g. &lt;code&gt;wdx-post-title&lt;/code&gt;. I write fewer posts than I would like to, so that simple construction will suffice for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;ulysses-or-1writer&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Ulysses or 1Writer? &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post was never intended to be a full review of either app and, in a sense, they are not really competing. Ulysses for Mac is a sound choice, with its ability to organise larger projects, such as books, as well as access external sources. 1Writer is not available for the Mac, but, handily for me, its files are stored in iCloud, which means they can be accessed and edited using other apps, including Ulysses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ulysses for iPad extends the reach and usefulness of its Mac-based sibling for book projects. If I was willing to give up on the idea that my notes should be accessible from everywhere, and from any app, then I dare say Ulysses would do a fine job. But I am not. As things stand, Ulysses for iPad, among many other apps, is limited in its ability to access external files. While it can import files stored in iCloud, such as those created by 1Writer, it can only do so one file at a time, making the importation of thousands of notes a logistical nightmare, and one that would be ongoing, as each new note created externally would have to be imported individually. It is also worth noting at this point that Dropbox support is on Ulysses for iPad’s developers’ roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For that reason and the fact that it is a solid Markdown editor in its own right, I am happy to store and edit my notes in 1Writer on my iPad. 1Writer also has an internal browser, accessible by swiping left while in any document, a useful research tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;backing-it-all-up&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Backing it all up &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2015-03-16-editorial-workflow/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back up, you say. Aren’t your files already backed up to iCloud? You can never have too many back-ups, I say. On my Mac, I use a simple rule in Noodlesoft’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php&quot; title=&quot;Hazel system preference pane&quot;&gt;Hazel&lt;/a&gt;, a system preference pane, to watch the 1Writer folder in iCloud Drive for new and modified documents and update and sync any changes to third-party storage service &lt;a href=&quot;https://copy.com?r=O1TVa2&quot;&gt;Copy&lt;/a&gt;. The date in the rule is set as the day before the first note in my collection was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/b2-mo3amNn-588.avif 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/b2-mo3amNn-588.webp 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A simple rule in Hazel ensures files are automatically backed up and synced with a third-party cloud service&quot; caption=&quot;A simple rule in Hazel ensures files are automatically backed up and synced with a third-party cloud service&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/b2-mo3amNn-588.png&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; height=&quot;444&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A simple rule in Hazel ensures files are automatically backed up and synced with a third-party cloud service&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of Ulysses for iPad, the developers also took the opportunity to update Ulysses for Mac to version 2.0. The update brings numerous improvements to what was already a great app, a few of which I will mention here. The entire interface has been redesigned to reflect the latest OS X update to Yosemite. Favourite documents now reside in the sidebar, quick export (⌘-6) has been revamped, there is a new dark mode, visible upload and download status for sheets, and attachments – keywords, notes, images – now have their own place on the toolbar. Note, though, that Ulysses’ attachment system for images does not work with external folders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I would like to see change is the manner in which Ulysses sorts documents. Change the sort status from ‘Manual’ to ‘Date Modified’ and the new status is applied to all projects, not only the active one. After changing the sort configuration, switch from a collection of notes for which the preferred view might be by ‘Date Modified’ to a book project – where a ‘Manual’ sort would be more appropriate – and chapters (sheets) are rendered in reverse order, assuming that project is intended to start with a sheet for the title page and end with a sheet for chapter &lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;. Go back and change the sort status if you want to see your book rendered properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a small quibble to have with what on the whole is one helluva a Markdown editor.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Create a plain text diary in iCloud using Drafts and Write for iOS</title>
		<link href="http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2014-09-28-plain-text-diary-using-drafts-with-write-for-ios/"/>
		<updated>2014-09-28T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2014-09-28-plain-text-diary-using-drafts-with-write-for-ios/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Keeping a diary is one thing I have never been good at.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; All those broken promises – to myself – whether during the days of pen and paper or, more recently, flirting with &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/day-one/id422304217?mt=12&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;Day One for Mac&lt;/a&gt;, weigh heavily. It is something that I feel I should do, but, more often than not, don’t. Previous attempts have required too much effort. I also don’t like the way diary entries in Day One are locked in and only accessible by a single app. Day One does offer the option to export entries to plain text, PDF or Markdown, the latter only in the Mac app, but that’s an extra step. I ruled out Evernote for similar reasons. Proprietary file formats, such as those used by Evernote and Microsoft Word, stifle productivity and portability. So, if a future-proof, plain text diary is what’s called for, it makes sense to create it in plain text from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Drang’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/08/better-work-diary-actions/&quot;&gt;‘Better work diary actions’&lt;/a&gt; convinced me that this was the way forward, not backward, as some might think. Drang’s work diary actions combine &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro/id532016360?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;Launch Center Pro&lt;/a&gt; (LCP) with &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id502385074?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;Drafts&lt;/a&gt; to create and save a note per day in Dropbox. Each note can contain multiple entries. He uses LCP for ‘status updates’ and ‘check-ins’ – short notes, like ‘Left home’ or ‘Arrived at work’ – that he can add simply by tapping an icon in Launch Center Pro. Drang may have good reasons for having a note per day, but I prefer a single note – daily-diary.txt – with new entries prepended to the file. As well as using LCP status updates similar to Drang’s, I can add longer entries by typing directly in Drafts and invoking my ‘Diary entry’ action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get down to the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;, it’s worth noting my reasons for keeping a diary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To track back and find out what I was doing on any given day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To record app purchases – as a reminder of how long I have been using an app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To record product purchases – for warranties and the like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To add my thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To record birthday and Christmas present purchases – so I don’t end up buying family members the same old dross time and again. This way they get a different kind of dross the following year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;icloud-instead-of-dropbox&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;iCloud instead of Dropbox &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2014-09-28-plain-text-diary-using-drafts-with-write-for-ios/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2014-09-28-plain-text-diary-using-drafts-with-write-for-ios/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2014-09-28-plain-text-diary-using-drafts-with-write-for-ios/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, Drang’s method uses Dropbox, but I’m swayed to use iCloud instead. So my Drafts’ action x-callbacks &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/write-for-iphone-note-taking/id587363157?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;Write for iPhone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/write-for-ipad-note-taking/id638171770?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;Write for iPad&lt;/a&gt;, both of which are set up to sync with iCloud. Write’s iOS apps will sync with iCloud &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; Dropbox, not both. So in making this choice, Write does not have access to my main ‘Notes’ folder, stored in Dropbox (at least it doesn’t on iOS). I am happy with this split workflow. My private thoughts and bookmarks (the subject of a future post) are stored in iCloud and accessible in Write. Here is the Drafts’ action:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/9Q7M6zbdGC-588.avif 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/9Q7M6zbdGC-588.webp 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The Drafts’ action&quot; caption=&quot;The Drafts’ action&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/9Q7M6zbdGC-588.png&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; height=&quot;466&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Drafts’ action&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what exactly is this doing? First we’re using Write’s url scheme, &lt;code&gt;write app://&lt;/code&gt;. We then tell it to &lt;code&gt;prepend&lt;/code&gt; the content of the current Drafts note, &lt;code&gt;[[draft]]&lt;/code&gt;, to a file called &lt;code&gt;Diary-entry.txt&lt;/code&gt;. But before adding &lt;code&gt;[[draft]]&lt;/code&gt;, we insert the current date and time as a Markdown level 2 heading (##): &lt;code&gt;%23&lt;/code&gt; is url encoding for a hash symbol, &lt;code&gt;%20&lt;/code&gt; for a space. Then we insert two linefeeds, &lt;code&gt;%0A%0A&lt;/code&gt;, followed by the note itself, &lt;code&gt;[[draft]]&lt;/code&gt;, and return to Drafts on successful completion of our entry. Note that I have not added any linefeeds at the end of the entry, as Write does this automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then on my Mac, I can access my diary in &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/write-note-taking-markdown/id848311469?mt=12&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;Write for Mac’s&lt;/a&gt; iCloud tab. Handily, Write allows me to access both my Write-only iCloud files, as well as my main ‘Notes’ folder in Dropbox and any other folder I choose to add to Write for Mac’s ‘Library’. I can open and edit &lt;code&gt;daily-diary.txt&lt;/code&gt; in Write for Mac as I see fit. But I have semi-automated the process by creating a simple &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/&quot;&gt;Keyboard Maestro&lt;/a&gt; macro, as shown in the screenshot below. Keyboard Maestro is a handy Mac productivity tool to have around. This particular macro does the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Locates and opens &lt;code&gt;daily-diary.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Starts a new entry by adding a Markdown-formatted date and time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Puts the cursor on a blank line ready to accept a new entry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/AbwhwP9Xgl-588.avif 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/AbwhwP9Xgl-588.webp 588w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A Keyboard Maestro macro to set up a new diary entry&quot; caption=&quot;A Keyboard Maestro macro to set up a new diary entry&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/AbwhwP9Xgl-588.png&quot; width=&quot;588&quot; height=&quot;409&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A Keyboard Maestro macro to set up a new diary entry&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some explanation of how I built this Keyboard Maestro might come in handy here. Select &lt;code&gt;This hot key&lt;/code&gt; from the toggle menu and assign a hot key in the field below; I chose &lt;code&gt;^⌘D&lt;/code&gt;. Type &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; in the Actions pane’s search field and double-click &lt;code&gt;Open a File, Folder or Application&lt;/code&gt; to add that action to your workflow. In the field next to &lt;code&gt;Open&lt;/code&gt; add the OS X text path&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;daily-diary.txt&lt;/code&gt; file. Next to &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt;, toggle &lt;code&gt;Default application&lt;/code&gt; and choose &lt;code&gt;Write&lt;/code&gt; from the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next action in the workflow automatically adds the date and time for the diary entry, and inserts a line space after. Return to the Action pane’s search field, type &lt;code&gt;Insert&lt;/code&gt; and double-click the &lt;code&gt;Insert Text&lt;/code&gt; action to add it to your workflow. As you can see from the image above, I have added the date and time as a Markdown level 2 heading (##), just as I did in the Drafts’ action I use on iOS. You can type out the &lt;code&gt;LongDate&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ShortTime&lt;/code&gt; strings or insert them from the &lt;code&gt;Insert Token&lt;/code&gt; drop down. Hit return twice and add the &lt;code&gt;Position cursor&lt;/code&gt; token from the &lt;code&gt;Insert Token&lt;/code&gt; drop down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Advantages &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2014-09-28-plain-text-diary-using-drafts-with-write-for-ios/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2014-09-28-plain-text-diary-using-drafts-with-write-for-ios/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2014-09-28-plain-text-diary-using-drafts-with-write-for-ios/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping a diary in this way is much more efficient than any of my old ways. It’s always only a few keystrokes or taps away, which makes it increasingly likely I will keep a diary in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also serves another purpose – check-ins. I’ve only ever dabbled with Foursquare and Facebook check-ins. But this is not the kind of information I feel the need to share with anyone else. Using Drang-style LCP status updates, I can keep a record of where I have been and what I was doing. These will serve as reminders should my future self want to find out what I was up to on any given day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are plenty of others things I’m not good at, but let’s focus on keeping a diary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use an &lt;a href=&quot;http://wordius.com/automator-service-copy-path-file-folder/&quot;&gt;Automator service&lt;/a&gt; to copy a file’s path to the clipboard. Another way to access a file or folder’s path is to drop it on to an open Terminal window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

		<title>The simplest productivity tip known to Mackind</title>
		<link href="http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-06-17-the-simplest-productivity-tip-known-to-mackind/"/>
		<updated>2013-06-17T00:00:00Z</updated>

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hide the dock. It’s as simple as &lt;code&gt;⌥-⌘-D&lt;/code&gt;, or point your mouse at &lt;code&gt;#F8FF &amp;gt; Dock &amp;gt; Turn hiding on/off&lt;/code&gt;. I can hear the in-rush of air as you suck volumes of the stuff between your teeth, but bear with me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the clutter in my Dock in the image below; look at the distracting new-email announcement. I often found it impossible to ignore that little red blob atop my email client. Ten minutes, 20 minutes, or 30 minutes might go by, but sooner or later I would find myself staring at my inbox, disappointed to discover I’d been drawn there by someone pedalling yet another magical SEO service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/TvboFLEilX-600.avif 600w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/TvboFLEilX-600.webp 600w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Dock in view: the Dock was too much of a distraction for my liking&quot; caption=&quot;Dock in view: the Dock was too much of a distraction for my liking&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/TvboFLEilX-600.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;338&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dock in view: the Dock was too much of a distraction for my liking&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first hid the Dock, my main goal was to reclaim screen space. It wasn’t till a few days later when I noticed that this simple action had had unexpected productivity benefits. I’d often find I had ten emails when I wasn’t aware I’d received any – none of them life-or-death urgent, I should add. This prompted me to develop a routine for checking email. Instead of diving in every five minutes, I only check it first thing in the morning, once around lunchtime and again late in the afternoon. Outside working hours the gloves are off, though – there’s no hiding from my iPhone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/Y0nLoACV-j-600.avif 600w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/Y0nLoACV-j-600.webp 600w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;OS X’s Dock is hidden&quot; caption=&quot;The Dock is gone: all that extra space is now available to open application windows and, more importantly, there’s less clutter to distract you from the job in hand. Granted, there’s not much going on in my case!&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/Y0nLoACV-j-600.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;338&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The Dock is gone: all that extra space is now available to open application windows and, more importantly, there’s less clutter to distract you from the job in hand. Granted, there’s not much going on in my case!&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back when I first made this magnificent discovery, hiding the Dock brought with it an urge to discover better ways to use my Mac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;anyone-for-a-spot-of-keyboarding&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Anyone for a spot of keyboarding? &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-06-17-the-simplest-productivity-tip-known-to-mackind/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-06-17-the-simplest-productivity-tip-known-to-mackind/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-06-17-the-simplest-productivity-tip-known-to-mackind/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With OS X’s Dock out of sight, I took the next step on the productivity ladder by using my keyboard rather than my mouse to launch apps and locate files and folders. I could write a book on keyboarding – and I’ve no doubt someone probably already has – but to round off this post, let’s just consider one technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spotlight is OS X’s built-in search application. It knows where everything is on your Mac, and it’s entire reason for being is to help you find what you’re looking for. Sadly, most of the people aren’t even aware of its existence, and many of those that do choose not to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To launch Spotlight you could reach for your mouse and click the magnifying glass in the menu bar at the top right of your screen, but &lt;code&gt;⌘-space bar&lt;/code&gt; then typing your query – the name of an app, file, or folder – is much quicker. Spotlight will do the rest, generating a list of the most relevant results. If Spotlight’s top result isn’t what you’re looking for, down-arrow to highlight the correct one then hit return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/y6o4xZz7ov-600.avif 600w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/y6o4xZz7ov-600.webp 600w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;OS X Spotlight&quot; caption=&quot;Type a query into OS X’s Spotlight to find and launch apps, files and folders on your Mac&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/y6o4xZz7ov-600.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;593&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Type a query into OS X’s Spotlight to find and launch apps, files and folders on your Mac&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple’s support site has a comprehensive list of &lt;a href=&quot;http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1343&quot;&gt;OS X keyboard shortcuts&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also worth bearing in mind that you can add your own shortcuts in &lt;code&gt;System Preferences &amp;gt; Keyboard&lt;/code&gt;, under the ‘Keyboard Shortcuts’ tab.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Custom dictionary search for Alfred</title>
		<link href="http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-03-24-alfred-dictionary-search/"/>
		<updated>2013-03-24T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-03-24-alfred-dictionary-search/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I upgraded to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alfredapp.com&quot;&gt;Alfred 2&lt;/a&gt;, there were a number of things that didn’t transfer well from Alfred 1. My dictionary search was one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This morning I had a trawl around the web to find which online dictionary gave the best results. Top, by a long shot, was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.merriam-webster.com&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which also includes tabbed access to a thesaurus and encyclopedia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s what the dictionary search edit screen looks like in Alfred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/tQBUnwv1EM-600.avif 600w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/tQBUnwv1EM-600.webp 600w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Alfred dictionary search&quot; caption=&quot;Alfred dictionary search&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/tQBUnwv1EM-600.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; height=&quot;360&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Harbingers of editorial change</title>

		<updated>2013-02-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-02-13-harbingers-of-editorial-change/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The week is only half baked and already we’ve seen announcements for two new tools that promise long-term benefits for editors and writers. The creators of Editorially and CriticMarkup are attempting to untether editors and writers from their old-school tools (mostly Word) and extend the capabilities of new tools (mostly Markdown).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcements in themselves may not be earth shattering, but there is no doubt in my mind that these new tools are harbingers of significant change in the content creation process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;write-collaborate-talk&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Write, collaborate, talk &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-02-13-harbingers-of-editorial-change/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-02-13-harbingers-of-editorial-change/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-02-13-harbingers-of-editorial-change/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://editorially.com&quot;&gt;Editorially&lt;/a&gt; tackles the job by swallowing it whole, by offering ‘an ecosystem for the writing process’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a Markdown-based writing environment lets you focus on the words and create clean markup easily; collaboration tools let you invite friends and trusted colleagues to review or edit your work; a document version system lets you mark points in a document’s history and compare versions to see what changed; notes and activity feeds encourage you to reflect on your work, for yourself and for others; and discussion threads recognize that the conversation around a text is just as important as the text itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact form Editorially will take is unclear, but the doors open soon. Find out for yourself by &lt;a href=&quot;http://editorially.com&quot;&gt;signing up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;find-accept-reject&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Find, accept, reject &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-02-13-harbingers-of-editorial-change/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-02-13-harbingers-of-editorial-change/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-02-13-harbingers-of-editorial-change/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://criticmarkup.com&quot;&gt;CriticMarkup&lt;/a&gt; is not an ecosystem; it is a syntax that you bolt on to your existing workflow, assuming that workflow involves writing in plain text. In the words of its developer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CriticMarkup is a way for authors and editors to track changes to documents in plain text. As with Markdown, small groups of distinctive characters allow you to highlight insertions, deletions, substitutions and comments, all without the overhead of heavy, proprietary office suites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn’t quite cover everything Word brings to the table, but it pretty much covers everything you need to prevent editors and writers from coming to blows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CriticMarkup’s developers have created a toolkit for a number of applications, such as BBEdit, SublimeText, Keyboard Maestro and TextExpander.&lt;/p&gt;

		<title>Rems, ems or pixels?</title>
		<link href="http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-25-rems-ems-or-pixels/"/>
		<updated>2013-01-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-25-rems-ems-or-pixels/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since reading Ethan Marcotte’s ‘Sizing the legible letter’&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; in 2011, I’ve been taken by the &lt;code&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; as a proportional unit for measuring the size of type. For far longer, I was against using the &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, the compounding proportional unit that resets the baseline every time the context changes. But I’m a control freak when it comes to type sizing. Before, and through, 2011 I used the pixel unit, and only the pixel, in all its fixed, stubbornly unmoving glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the record, I also used fixed-width layouts; that’s how stuck in the sand my head was. No fluidity here, sir; none at all. The tide is well and truly out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after reading Marcotte’s piece I was smitten by the rem’s single-context usage: ‘sizing text up or down from a baseline value’. Make that baseline 10px:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    html {font-size: 62.5%;} /* 0.625 x 16px = 10px */
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;where 16px is the default browser font-size for medium text&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and you’re talking math for dummies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounded like a no-brainer, so from that day to this I’ve used the rem with a pixel fallback, the latter providing support for IE8 and earlier, and Opera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-em-has-legs&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;The em has legs &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-25-rems-ems-or-pixels/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-25-rems-ems-or-pixels/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-25-rems-ems-or-pixels/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That takes care of font-size. But what about other attributes, such as margins and padding? In ‘On ems and rems’&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, Filament Group’s Scott Jehl says ‘rems and ems serve different purposes and need not be mutually exclusive’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He adds:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[R]ems…can be less helpful when designing proportional whitespace, such as padding and margins that surround the typography in a fluid layout. This is where em units shine. Take for example, a block of content that contains a heading and a paragraph. The amount of spacing that feels comfortable between the heading and the paragraph (and the space between them and adjacent pieces of content) will often change depending on the size of the text. Using em units for the margins and padding in cases like this mean the spacing will automatically adjust in proportion to the font-size, regardless of what it may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, it would seem, the em still has its uses, just not here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;still-in-em-denial&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Still in em denial &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-25-rems-ems-or-pixels/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-25-rems-ems-or-pixels/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-25-rems-ems-or-pixels/&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is what you might call minimally fluid, or adaptive–responsive. The type measure on the main blog element is managed down. In fact, through the first breakpoint at 767px the width of the main body text doesn’t change at all; only the margins contract. It remains fixed at 556px till comfortably below the ‘small tablet’ portrait screen width of 600px. At that point, all restrictions are lifted and fluidity reigns; the tide is in, folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this is achieved using my favoured rem–pixel–fallback formula. Happily these days, though, I write all the code in a CSS preprocessor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://sass-lang.com&quot;&gt;Sass&lt;/a&gt;, which takes care of all the donkey work – the math; yes, even the stuff for dummies. There’s still no place here for the em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the process of converting all units for font sizes, paddings, margins and widths to rems. Ray Brown’s rem()&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Sass mixin is making my life easier. For example, writing this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    .element {
        @include rem(&#39;max-width&#39;, 556px);
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in my Sass document translates to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    .element {
        max-width: 556px; // for older browsers
        max-width: 55.6rem; // for funky browsers
    }
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in my CSS, excluding the comments. So far so good. The mixin is playing ball. You can pick up the full code from github via the link below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rem is supported by the current versions of all major browsers, with legacy support in some&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; – not in IE8, mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The article that turned me on to the rem in the first place was Ethan Marcotte’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.typekit.com/2011/11/09/type-study-sizing-the-legible-letter/&quot;&gt;Type study: Sizing the legible letter&lt;/a&gt; on the Typekit blog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2004, Richard Rutter uttered ‘62.5%’ in &lt;a href=&quot;http://clagnut.com/blog/348/&quot;&gt;How to size text using ems&lt;/a&gt;; many listened&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scott Jehl, The Filament Group, outlines the case for combining em and rem units in &lt;a href=&quot;http://filamentgroup.com/lab/on_ems_and_rems/&quot;&gt;On ems and rems&lt;/a&gt;. He has a point&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Github code source for Ray Brown’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/bitmanic/rem/tree/master/test&quot;&gt;rem() Sass mixin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Browser support for the rem, as compiled by &lt;a href=&quot;http://caniuse.com/#feat=rem&quot;&gt;Can I use…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Pen and paper – reviving the Filofax</title>
		<link href="http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-11-reviving-the-filofax/"/>
		<updated>2013-01-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-11-reviving-the-filofax/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Paperless GTD&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; aficionados will quake in their task managers at the thought, but the new year brings for me a new Filofax. Apps are all well and good, but I’m far from ready to dismiss pen and paper entirely from my arsenal of writing, note-taking – and task management – tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;picture&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/avif&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/VfqIVhsn0C-705.avif 705w&quot;&gt;&lt;source type=&quot;image/webp&quot; srcset=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/VfqIVhsn0C-705.webp 705w&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Filofax Cuban (£68.88) and Parker Urban rollerball (£14.24)&quot; caption=&quot;Filofax Cuban (£68.88) and Parker Urban rollerball (£14.24)&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;http://blog.macminded.co.uk/img/VfqIVhsn0C-705.png&quot; width=&quot;705&quot; height=&quot;530&quot;&gt;&lt;/picture&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Filofax Cuban (£68.88) and Parker Urban rollerball (£14.24)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought my first Filofax in 1986, the year Microsoft Corp. held its Initial Public Offering, and Steve Jobs and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc.&quot;&gt;Apple Computer, Inc.&lt;/a&gt; reached an out-of-court settlement following his departure from the company he founded with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne in 1976. Jobs was already knee-deep in a new venture, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXT&quot;&gt;NeXT, Inc.&lt;/a&gt;, which Apple would buy a decade later, opening the door for Jobs to return to Apple as a consultant in 1997. These were the early days of mass computing – even Windows had yet to see the light – and paper-based to-do lists, task managers and diaries were, for most, the only ways to keep records and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years that followed my Filofax lost favour as a contact manager, a task taken on first by a simple text file, then a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Tungsten&quot;&gt;Palm Pilot Tungsten T&lt;/a&gt;. I continued to use my Filofax as a diary till four years ago when I bought an iPhone. My pocket-sized organiser was put on a shelf and that’s where it has stayed to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I found I was still scribbling in notebooks; many of the notes took the form of reminders or records, the kind of notes that really should be organised. There are apps designed for that, I know. Teuxdeux (&lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/teuxdeux/id384291782?mt=8&amp;amp;uo=4&amp;amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;App Store&lt;/a&gt;, an iPhone app with a web interface, is one of the better ones for simple day-to-day tasks. But breaking the habit of a lifetime – picking up a pen and making some, occasionally coherent, marks on paper – is something I don’t think I’ll ever get out of my system. So I decided not to fight it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture, above, shows the result, a new Filofax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Specifically, Filofax’s Cuban A5 organiser, in rich, soft Italian leather. It’s big enough to cope and sturdy enough that I can throw it in a bag and use it as a ‘laptop’ when I’m visiting clients. I’ll never have to worry about losing charge, or lugging cables, or which direction the sun is coming through the window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some tasks, however, that the Filofax is not suited to. These are the big projects I manage for clients day in and day out. Numerous tasks go into completing a single project, and the list of tasks involved remains pretty much the same from one project to the next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s where project-management apps come into their own. Before Christmas, I trialled Things&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and Omnifocus&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Midway through the trial, Omnigroup announced that it would be releasing a new version of Omnifocus at the end of January 2013. I decided to wait and find out what all the fuss is about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meantime, I’ll make do with my Filofax and a plain-text document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GTD stands for Getting Things Done, the time-management methodology promoted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.davidco.com/&quot;&gt;David Allen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.filofax.com/default_int.asp&quot;&gt;Filofax official site&lt;/a&gt;: If I have one complaint about my Filofax, it’s that I couldn’t buy it with a day-to-a-page diary as standard. Instead, it came with a week-to-view diary; I had to buy a standalone day-to-a-page diary set and switch it in. The week-to-view diary is little more than a waste of paper. (Any takers? You can have it for the cost of the postage.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Things Mac app: &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/things/id407951449?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Omnifocus Mac app: &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=11l4We&quot;&gt;Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

		<title>Getting things done with Semantic Notes</title>
		<link href="http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-08-getting-things-done-with-semantic-notes/"/>
		<updated>2013-01-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
		<id>http://blog.macminded.co.uk/blog/2013-01-08-getting-things-done-with-semantic-notes/</id>
		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Last night when I tapped a link in &lt;a href=&quot;http://macdrifter.com/&quot;&gt;MacDrifter’s&lt;/a&gt; RSS feed in Mr Reader (since closed) on my iPad, I wasn’t sure what to expect. Two hours later I’d read, and re-read, Tyler Reinhard’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://semanot.es&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done with Semantic Notes&lt;/a&gt;. Reinhard says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first obvious change I needed to make was the process by which I take, process, refer to, review, and store notes. I needed something with a long lifespan, that requires little maintenance, and allows for an efficient weekly review. A system I can trust with my low-rent schemes, project-related brainstorms, and moments of epiphany. And, it has to prime those things for future use and next-actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I immediately wrote a few test notes, and it works – for the most part. The one stumbling block is my mobile note-taking app, Notesy. Dropbox issues forced me to quit Simplenote a few months ago. I replaced it with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.notesy.app/&quot;&gt;Notesy&lt;/a&gt;. But Notesy, annoyingly, strips spaces from the front of note titles, rendering a valuable part of this system useless. (Unprocessed scratch note titles are preceded by a space so they filter to the top when the list is displayed in descending alphabetical order.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Notesy is still a great notes app. It has the three key features I look for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;syncs with &lt;a href=&quot;http://db.tt/jw9tyCz&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;supports Markdown&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;searches inside notes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many notes apps offer the first two features, but, as of this morning, few came to mind that offered the third. This afternoon, a comment from another reader of Reinhard’s post, Alan Schauer, pointed me at &lt;a href=&quot;https://nebulousapps.net/&quot;&gt;Nebulous Notes&lt;/a&gt;. So I’ll give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and read Reinhard’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://semanot.es&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done with Semantic Notes&lt;/a&gt;. Less than 24 hours after doing just that, I’m implementing a similar system. Spring (note) cleaning came early this year.&lt;/p&gt;
